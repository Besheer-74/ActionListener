  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/heart-button/
    - assets/images/regular-player/
    - assets/images/repeat-button/
    - assets/images/shuffle-button/
    - assets/images/mini-player/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: MetalMania
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MetalMania-Regular.ttf
    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
  # fonts:

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
